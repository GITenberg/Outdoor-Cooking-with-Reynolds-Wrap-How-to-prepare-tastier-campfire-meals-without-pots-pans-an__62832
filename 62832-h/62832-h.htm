<p>This booklet on Outdoor Cooking is presented to make outdoor
life more enjoyable for the thousands of campers who take to the
open fields, woodlands, and streams of America each year.</p>
<p>It is written to demonstrate the new aluminum foil way to cook
out of doors ... endorsed by expert campers, camping associations,
and rod and gun clubs throughout the country.</p>
<p>Alert campers who discover new uses for Reynolds Wrap (aluminum
foil) are urged to write the publisher, Reynolds Metals Company, who
will try to include them in subsequent editions of this manual ...
thereby assisting other campers to a happier day afield.</p>

<br /><span class="center smallest black"><i>What it is and how campers use it</i></span></h2>
<p>Aluminum foil, as widely distributed under the name Reynolds
Wrap, is pure aluminum. Reynolds Wrap is available at grocery,
drug, department and other stores throughout most of the U. S.</p>
<p>Aluminum is often called the &ldquo;miracle metal&rdquo; ... and it is in the
form of aluminum foil that its miracle properties are most evident.</p>
<p>Housewives line frying pans with it, wrap meat and fowl for roasting,
etc. Campers wrap their food in it and drop the package in
the hot coals of the campfire. They thus eliminate scouring pots
and pans and washing dishes ... the unpleasant chores of camping
out.</p>
<p>The heat-reflective property is, again, most dramatically demonstrated
by the foil. It is used by housewives to line broiler pans
and reflect heat upward to broil the underside of a steak (and to
save on pan scouring). At campfires, reflective ovens are constructed
of Reynolds Wrap&mdash;to bake bread, biscuits, and even small pies.</p>
<p>Wrapping an object in pure aluminum foil is a unique experience.
No strings, rubber bands, or other fastenings are required
... the wrap molds to any shape, and holds it. By crimping edges,
the package is sealed against moisture, air, light, and odor. Little
wonder it is so widely used to keep certain foods fresh and moist.
On a day&rsquo;s outing or overnight hike, campers prepare several meals
before they start out, wrap each in Reynolds Wrap, toss them
into their pockets ... and all that remains is to build a fire and
drop the &ldquo;packaged meal&rdquo; in the coals.</p>
<p>Reynolds Wrap cuts down &ldquo;camp chores&rdquo; and makes outdoor life
more fun.... See the menus and recipes on the following pages for
dozens of ideas, every one proved at the campfire.</p>
<p>CAUTION:&mdash;Obviously, foods and sandwich spreads that normally
require refrigeration must be kept iced to assure positive protection.</p>

<p>After a hard day of whipping the stream or tramping the woods,
have you ever returned to your base camp to find a pile of greasy,
smoky-black pots and kettles waiting to be scoured? Or have you
ever awakened in the morning to meet the mess of the night before?</p>
<p>Ah, now you remember ... you were in a hurry to get away at
break of day, or the evening darkness fell too soon. You left the
cooking utensils unwashed. So now, before the meal can be prepared,
the oatmeal pot must be scrubbed out and the frying pan
scoured clean. It&rsquo;s unpleasant work and it takes time. Even the
most moderate tempers sometimes flare up when hunger bites and
there is no prospect of immediate food.</p>
<p>But Reynolds Wrap has solved this problem once and for all.
Pots, pans, and dishes are no longer necessary on a camping trip.</p>
<p>Read the suggestions in this booklet carefully.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">Six things to remember for better outdoor cooking</span></h2>
<p class="revint"><span class="b i ss xxlarge green">1.</span> A bed of hot coals is the thing. Never use a flaming
fire (except when using a reflector oven).</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="b i ss xxlarge green">2.</span> Fold the Reynolds Wrap into a package according to
instructions on <a href="#Page_7">Page 7</a>. Practice this several times.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="b i ss xxlarge green">3.</span> Always add shortening, fat, butter, or bacon to package
before cooking.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="b i ss xxlarge green">4.</span> Cooking times will vary with wind strength, type of
firewood, and many other factors. All the times given
in this booklet are approximate, of course&mdash;a campfire
has no thermostat.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="b i ss xxlarge green">5.</span> It&rsquo;s a good idea to turn a package at approximately
half its cooking time.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="b i ss xxlarge green">6.</span> Package must be crimped carefully for complete sealing
to keep in moisture ... to assure &ldquo;pressure cooking.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>This explanation is of utmost importance and must be followed
closely for the best results in cooking. All cooking is done in
DOUBLE foil envelopes.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="b i ss xxlarge green">1.</span> Place item to be cooked on a sheet of Reynolds Wrap.
Wrap should be big enough to allow for a three-fold
crimping of open edges.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="b i ss xxlarge green">2.</span> Next fold in half and crimp the three open edges.
Make three folds on these edges. This makes
an air-tight envelope.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="b i ss xxlarge green">3.</span> Take another sheet of Reynolds Wrap the same size as
the first, repeat process, making a double layer
around the food.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="b i ss xxlarge green">4.</span> This package is placed right on the coals. When the
food is cooked, the three crimped edges can be
torn off in zipper fashion. The contents are then
eaten from the wrap, doing away with a dish or plate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">How to build the right kind of fire</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="{Uncaptioned}" width="800" height="247" />
</div>
<p>The right kind of fire for aluminum foil cooking is really no fire
at all, but rather a bed of hot coals. The Boy Scout Merit Badge
Book on cooking explains how to get a bed of coals as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The camp fire generally supplies a good bed of coals, but sometimes
this is needed in a hurry, soon after camp is pitched. To get
it, take sound hardwood, either green or dead, and split it into
sticks of uniform thickness (say 1&frac14; inch face). Lay down two
bed-sticks, cross these near the ends with two others, and so on
up until you have a pen or crib a foot high. Start a fire in this pen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then cover the top of the pen with a layer of parallel sticks laid
an inch apart. Cross this with a similar layer at right angles, and
so upward for another foot. The free draft will make a roaring
fire, and it will all burn down to coals together. The thick bark of
hemlock, and of hardwoods generally will soon give you coals for
cooking. To keep coals for a long time cover them with ashes, or
with bark which will quickly burn to ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">Try these camp ideas</span></h2>
<p>In taking lunches from the base camp, Reynolds Wrap will help in
two ways: First, sandwiches, cake, cookies, etc. are wrapped to hold
freshness, to prevent them from getting wet in case of rain. (Be sure
sandwiches do not contain dressing, etc. that normally should be
kept under refrigeration.) Secondly, if a hot meal is desired (some
campers due to health conditions, must have a hot meal at noon)
take a chop or a piece of meat, place it in the wrap with a patty
of butter, add slices of potato &frac14; inch thick, onion, carrot or other
vegetable sliced and seal package securely. This package can be
put in a camp fire on the trail and cooked in 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
<p>On a field trip requiring 2 or 3 meals, each meal can be prepared
at home before leaving. It is sealed at home and ready for the
fire in a moment&rsquo;s notice. Label the meals Lunch, Supper, etc.</p>
<p>If fish or other game is to be cooked in camp in a kettle or frying
pan, line the pan with Reynolds Wrap before cooking, thus eliminating
a &ldquo;rough&rdquo; scouring job and, perhaps, fish-tasting sausages
the next morning.</p>
<p>A round, six inch piece of Reynolds Wrap carried in the pack or
pocket can be quickly shaped into a conical drinking cup for a quick
refreshing drink on the trail. This
cup can be used over and over
again.</p>
<p>There are many campers and
woodsmen who camp the year
round. The problem of keeping
food from freezing in intense cold
is solved by wrapping the food in
Reynolds Wrap, then newspaper
and then Reynolds Wrap around
the outside of the package. This
applies to canned goods, potatoes,
fresh fruit, liquids, etc.</p>
<p>Many campers protect articles they
carry in their pockets by wrapping
in Reynolds Wrap. Matches are
protected against dampening, exposed
film is sealed away from
light, etc. Small objects are
wrapped together so they can&rsquo;t
get lost.</p>

<p><span class="ss">DIRECTIONS</span>: An aluminum foil &ldquo;pot&rdquo; can be made by forming
doubled Reynolds Wrap around a forked sapling. The size pot will
depend upon the number in the party. Place dried fruit in enough
water to cover them, the night before. A little more water can be
added in the morning, if necessary, also a small amount (2-3 teaspoons)
of sugar if desired. The pot is carefully placed at edge of
camp fire. Oatmeal is cooked in a similar pot. Add &frac12; cup of
oatmeal to each cup of boiling water. Add &frac14; teaspoon of salt to
boiling water, then stir in oatmeal. When it thickens it&rsquo;s ready.
Now, shape up a similar pan of doubled foil and place bacon in it.
When it is about half done, drop in 2 eggs. Eggs should be cooked
sunnyside up as it may be difficult for beginners to turn them. Toast
is made by sticking 2 or 3 pencil sized saplings, 10 inches long into
the ground near the fire. Hang the slices of bread on them and
don&rsquo;t forget to turn them&mdash;you are not using a &ldquo;pop up&rdquo; toaster.</p>
<p>Coffee of the instant type can be made by using another &ldquo;foil

<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">Baking camp bread</span></h2>
<p>One of the highlights of any camping trip can be the baking of
camp bread or hot biscuits. Nothing equals hot biscuits and jam.
This operation is generally misunderstood by the unseasoned woodsman.
It is thought to be quite involved and complicated. Nothing
could be further from the truth. It can be extremely easy. Those
who frequent the deep woods where &ldquo;store&rdquo; bread is unobtainable
or difficult to transport need only take any good prepared biscuit mix,
and the bread problem is solved.</p>
<p>Since Reynolds Wrap has come into general use by Campers and
Woodsmen the bread-making job is much easier. You need no
cumbersome reflector oven on the trip. A reflector oven is made in
two ways:</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="b i ss xxlarge green">1.</span> Take a 24 inch piece of Reynolds Wrap and bend it in the
center at a 45&deg; angle. Place on a stone or other flat
surface 6 inches above the ground and close to the edge
of a flaming fire. Mix the biscuit dough using water. This
can be done in a paper bag or a container shaped up from
another piece of foil. Grease the bottom of the reflector
oven slightly and shape 2 inch pieces of dough and place
on the bottom of reflector. It is best to rub a small amount
of dry mix on the fingers before shaping the biscuits so that
the dough does not stick to the fingers. Place the oven so
that an intense heat can be felt in front of the oven. When
biscuits have browned on top turn them over by hand for
a minute or two to bake the bottom of the biscuits. The
whole baking operation should not take over 10 minutes if
the fire is hot.</p>
<p class="revint"><span class="b i ss xxlarge green">2.</span> The second type of oven is built as follows: This is a permanent
type of oven and remains stationary during the
camp trip. Locate the site for your own camp fire. At the
very edge of the fire drive 2 stakes an inch in diameter into
the ground so they are at least 15 inches above the ground
and 18 inches apart. Directly in back of these stakes and
in line with them 16 inches back drive 2 similar stakes. Now
tie cross pieces 9 inches from the ground on both the front
and rear stakes. Stretch a piece of foil across these two
horizontal sticks so it is rigid and tucked in around both
sticks. This is the shelf. Now tie cross pieces on the front
stakes six inches above and six inches below the shelf.
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
Stretch Reynolds Wrap from the bottom cross piece back
around the outside of the shelf and up to the top cross piece.
Tuck it in securely and the oven is ready for baking.
Caution: When heavy articles such as hamburgers, chops,
etc. are placed on the shelf, distribute the weight. Take
care not to overload the shelf. Eight to ten biscuits can be
baked at one time. When the front row is browned, move
it to the back and the back row to the front. (Best results
can be obtained with reflector ovens by using a double
thickness of Reynolds Wrap.)</p>
<p>Reynolds Wrap is now standard equipment on all fishing, camping
and hiking trips.</p>

<p>Clean a &frac34; pound fowl and fasten securely on a green wood spit.
Wrap bird with two wrappings of Reynolds Wrap and press ends
firmly on spit to seal. (Wrap exposed parts of spit to insulate from
fire.) Turn occasionally and cook over coals for one hour and
fifteen minutes. Remove wrap and brown further over coals if
desired. The spit should not be farther than 8-10 inches from the
coals. The fact that Reynolds Wrap is being used will eliminate
constant turning as all of the moisture of the bird is sealed in. It
can be left in one position up to fifteen minutes before turning again.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">&ldquo;roast beef&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p>A four to five pound boned rolled roast can be cooked as follows:</p>
<p>Secure roast on a green wood spit and wrap with two layers of
Reynolds Wrap. Press ends of wrap firmly against spit to seal.
(Wrap exposed parts of spit with wrap to insulate it from fire.) Turn
occasionally and cook twenty to twenty-five minutes per pound over
hot coals. Arrange the spit so that the roast is not over six to eight
inches from the glowing coals. Unwrap carefully if you want to
save the juice. The flavor of meat cooked in this fashion is far
superior to that of meat cooked without the wrap since all of the
juices are sealed in completely. A large portion of meat such as
the above or larger can be exposed to an intense heat without burning
if it is turned occasionally.</p>

<p>Place steak in large envelope of Reynolds Wrap with sliced onions
and seasoning to taste. Seal envelope and cover with another
envelope of foil. Place on hot coals allowing ten minutes on each
side for medium rare steak.</p>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">picnic novelties</span></h2>
<p><span class="ss">SWEET POTATOES (candied sweet)</span>&mdash;Peel and shoe string sweet
potato (one). Place on Reynolds Wrap, add two tablespoons water,
and about one-half cup brown sugar. Fold and wrap. Bake approximately
seven minutes each side on bed of hot coals.</p>
<p><span class="ss">BANANA-YUM</span>&mdash;Cut both ends off a banana in skin (unpeeled).
Slice down center and sprinkle with brown sugar. Fold and wrap,
sealing tightly. Bake on hot coals about six minutes each side.
Serve hot.</p>
<p><span class="ss">BAKED APPLE</span>&mdash;Core and fill apple with sugar, raisins, nuts, etc.
Place on double square of Reynolds Wrap. Gather foil up over top
and twist together. Bake on hot coals.</p>

<p>Mix prepared biscuit flour as per directions and roll out thin, about
&frac14; inch. Cut in pieces large enough to surround frankfurter but let
the frankfurter protrude a half-inch or so at each end. Put in
double envelope of Reynolds Wrap and place on a medium fire of
coals. Cook for fifteen minutes turning frequently. This novelty
is very tasty and a grand picnic stunt. It must be remembered, however,
to roll the franks over quite often as they cook. This will keep
them from scorching.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
